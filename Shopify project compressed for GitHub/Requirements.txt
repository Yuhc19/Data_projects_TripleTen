Shopify App Analysis
By Jesus Acevedo

RAW DATA: shopify.xlsx

Objective: To review the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform, using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites, to identify what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app.

The dataset includes 4 tables: 
apps: Details of the apps on Shopify apps marketplace.

apps_categories: Join tables to connect apps with categories.

categories: Categories of the apps. Each app has multiple categories.

reviews: Each review (row) contains information on user opinion about the related app (rating and comment). Also, it contains the response from the developer if present.

Part 1: App Landscape
Made a KPI Card (a visual with a single number) that counts the unique number of apps. Added it to the App Landscape sheet.
Made a Line Chart getting the sum of the review count on the Y-axis, and the lastmod date on the X-Axis. Made a Scatterplot with the reviews_count on the X axis and the average rating on the Y axis. Annotated the interpretation of this with an inserted Text Box next to this scatterplot.

Part 2: Reviews
Created a new Column in the Reviews table named helpful_reviews using a DAX expression, which multiplies the rating by 1+helpful_count to weigh the reviews by how helpful theyâ€™ve been found. Made a Card with the average value of the new helpful_reviews column.
Created a new Column in the Reviews table named developer_answered using a DAX expression, which is 1 (or TRUE) if the developer_reply column is not blank and 0 (or FALSE) if the column row is blank. Made a scatterplot comparing the average rating on the Y-Axis by the value of the developer_answered column on the X-Axis.

Part 3: App Reviews
In the data model, created a new relationship between the Reviews table and the Apps table. Used the app_id column from the Reviews table, the id column from the Apps table. Made the relationship many-to-one built as many (Reviews table) to one (Apps table). Using this new table, made a bar chart with the developer on the X-Axis, and the sum of rating on the Y-Axis.
Made a new bar chart with developer on the X-Axis against the helpful_review average on the Y-Axis.
Made a bar chart with the developer from the apps table and the developer_answered column. Added a Filter for this visual only which selects only the rows where reviews_count is greater than 500.
