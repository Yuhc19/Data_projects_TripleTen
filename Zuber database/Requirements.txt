Zuber database
Completed by Jesus Acevedo Delatorre

Project description provided by Tripleten
"You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

Working with a database, you'll analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency."

Description of the data:

A database with info on taxi rides in Chicago:

neighborhoods table: data on city neighborhoods

name: name of the neighborhood
neighborhood_id: neighborhood code
cabs table: data on taxis

cab_id: vehicle code
vehicle_id: the vehicle's technical ID
company_name: the company that owns the vehicle
trips table: data on rides

trip_id: ride code
cab_id: code of the vehicle operating the ride
start_ts: date and time of the beginning of the ride (time rounded to the hour)
end_ts: date and time of the end of the ride (time rounded to the hour)
duration_seconds: ride duration in seconds
distance_miles: ride distance in miles
pickup_location_id: pickup neighborhood code
dropoff_location_id: dropoff neighborhood code
weather_records table: data on weather

record_id: weather record code
ts: record date and time (time rounded to the hour)
temperature: temperature when the record was taken
description: brief description of weather conditions, e.g. "light rain" or "scattered clouds"

Note: there isn't a direct connection between the tables trips and weather_records in the database. But you can still use JOIN and link them using the time the ride started (trips.start_ts) and the time the weather record was taken (weather_records.ts). 

Exploratory data analysis:

Find the number of taxi rides for each taxi company for November 15-16, 2017. Name the resulting field trips_amount and print it along with the company_name field. Sort the results by the trips_amount field in descending order. **
Find the number of rides for every taxi company whose name contains the words "Yellow" or "Blue" for November 1-7, 2017. Name the resulting variable trips_amount. Group the results by the company_name field.
In November 2017, the most popular taxi companies were Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services. Find the number of rides for these two companies and name the resulting variable trips_amount. Join the rides for all other companies in the group "Other." Group the data by taxi company names. Name the field with taxi company names company. Sort the result in descending order by trips_amount.
Step 2. Determine if and how the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays compared to other days of the week and other weather conditions.

Retrieve the identifiers of the O'Hare and Loop neighborhoods from the neighborhoods table.
For each hour, retrieve the weather condition records from the weather_records table. Using the CASE operator, break all hours into two groups: "Bad" if the description field contains the words "rain" or "storm," and "Good" for others. Name the resulting field weather_conditions. The final table must include two fields: date and hour (ts) and weather_conditions.
Retrieve from the trips table all the rides that started in the Loop (neighborhood_id: 50) and ended at O'Hare (neighborhood_id: 63) on a Saturday. Get the weather conditions for each ride. Use the method you applied in the previous task. Also retrieve the duration of each ride. Ignore rides for which data on weather conditions is not available.
