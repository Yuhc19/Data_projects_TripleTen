| DATA | Single table |
| Description |Contains 5 tabs/sheets: Data, Visuals A, Visuals B, Visuals C, and Insights and recommendastions |
| Assumptions | Marketing should try focused campaigns targeting typical demographics for fans of these genres.
We should analyze user retention in these genres, and consider how we can maximize it.
Product/marketing teams should try experiments to generate leads in alternative genres.
Consider intermediate tiers between free and paid, to make it easier to convert users from free to paid.
Offer users a referral marketing option, so they can get a free trial of the paid tier by referring new users.
It is worth doing deeper research into previous years to understand why pop is on a downwards trend.
Try promotions focused on rock that offer free trials to convert to paid users.
We should analyze more ways to increase the engagement of rock-listening users, as a potential growth segment.
Paid users are very valuable, so it is worth offering time-limited promotions and other deals to convert users from free to paid.
Indie is particularly popular with paid users, so focus promotions there. |
| Findings | Pop genre peaked in 2021 and is on a downwards trend
Paid users are more active (listen to more music) than free.
Rock is the most popular genre for free users.
Electronic and hip hop music are overall on an upwards trend.
Paid users have steadier growth and better user retention than free. |
